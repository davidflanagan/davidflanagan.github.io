Here's the marketing copy I wrote for the back cover of the book:

---
JavaScript is the programming language of the web and is used by more
software developers today than any other programming language. For
nearly 25 years this best seller has been the go-to guide for
JavaScript programmers. The seventh edition is fully updated to cover
the 2020 version of JavaScript, and new chapters cover classes,
modules, iterators, generators, Promises, async/await, and
metaprogramming. You’ll find illuminating and engaging example code
throughout.

This book is for programmers who want to learn JavaScript and for web
developers who want to take their understanding and mastery to the
next level. It begins by explaining the JavaScript language itself, in
detail, from the bottom up. It then builds on that foundation to cover
the web platform and Node.js.

Topics include:

- Types, values, variables, expressions, operators, statements,
  objects, and arrays
- Functions, classes, modules, iterators, generators, Promises, and
  async/await
- JavaScript’s standard library: data structures, regular expressions,
  JSON, i18n, etc.
- The web platform: documents, components, graphics, networking,
  storage, and threads
- Node.js: buffers, files, streams, threads, child processes, web
  clients, and web servers
- Tools and language extensions that professional JavaScript
  developers rely on

I'll have lots more to say (not marketing copy) about the new book
future post. Meanwhile, though, I want to drop this screenshot from
Amazon's US site:

Thank you to everyone who has pre-ordered my book and has made that
image possible.

The weeks leading up to a book's publication are a particularly
important time for pre-orders because it generates publicity and helps
the publisher know what size print run to schedule.

So if you already know that you want to own the new edition of this
book, now would be [a great time to order it](https://amzn.to/2xd5qCn).
