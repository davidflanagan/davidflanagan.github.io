I've started a new blog to celebrate the fact that after 9 years there
will finally be a new seventh edition of _JavaScript: The Definitive Guide_!

That is the same rhino that has been on the cover of all previous
editions. But it looks grumpier to me with this new all-white cover
style that O'Reilly has switched to.

The early release version [is available online from the
publisher](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920048633.do) today,
and the [print version](https://amzn.to/2KA44Vz) should start shipping
in early June.
